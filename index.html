                    <h1>Income inequality around the world</h1>

                    <p>
                        Ever since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), income inequality is at the center of public debate. A lot of data is available on this subject. This page makes an attempt to give some insight into this data in a way that is easy to understand.

                    This world map shows how much of the national income is obtained by the top 10%, top 1%, or bottom 10% in several countries. As you can see, the top 10% in Europe does not gather as much of the GDP as they do in, for example, Arab countries or the USA. You will also notice that the bottom 10% in Europe takes a relatively large piece of the pie, compared to other parts of the world.

                <p>
                    The pie represents the GDP of the selected country in the selected year; the incomes of all people combined. The pie consists of 10 pieces, each piece belonging to 10% of the population. See how the sizes of these pieces are different across countries and time. In some countries, the top 10% gathers more than half of all income, like in Qatar.

                <p>
                    Move the mouse over a pie piece (or a person) to see the exact percentage and the average income in that group.

                    The Lorenz curve
                </h2>

                <p>
                    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_curve" target="_blank">Lorenz curve</a> is an informative way of showing the income distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lorenz curve shows how much of the income is earned by the bottom X %. In a completely equal society, 20% of the people would earn 20% of the income, and 78% of the people would earn 78% of the income, and so on. The curve would then be a perfectly diagonal line. The more the real curve deviates from this diagonal, the more unequal a society's income is distributed.

                    This line graph displays the size of the shares of all income groups across time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will see that in most countries, the top 10% increased their share of the income in the last decades. An especially interesting (but not surprising) spike in the share of the top 10% can be found in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, nothing ever changes at all.
