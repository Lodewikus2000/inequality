# inequality

## Problem statement

Data on inequality is widely available, but there is no easy to understand visualization of this data. Complicated line graphs of gini coefficients or bar charts of share of the 1% mean don't communicate the data clear enough.


## Solution

The solution is a visualization of inequality data in human terms, mainly focused on income and wealth inequality.


### Main features

#### Minimum viable product
A world map where the user can select a country. Country color based on some measure of inequality.
Country view: shares of national income (or wealth) divided over 10 or 100 people. The representation of the share of income (or wealth) can be a bar chart where the bars are made to look like money, or parts of a pie chart.
Graph view: something over time?

#### Optional
Information about inequality when it comes to life expectancy, government spending on social programs.
