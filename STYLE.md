This project mostly follow this style: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp
with some exceptions.

# Indentation
We use 4 spaces for indentation

# Line length
We have no problem with line lengths exceeding 80 characters.

# Whitespace
Use whitespace wherever it makes the code more legible. 3 newlines between big functions? Fine.
